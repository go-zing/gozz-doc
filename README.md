## Introduction

[English](https://go-zing.github.io/gozz) | [简体中文](https://go-zing.github.io/gozz/zh)

## Contributing

This site is built with [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress).
Site content is written in Markdown format located in src.
For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is preferred as package manager:

```bash
yarn
yarn docs:dev
```

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as
optional chaining.
